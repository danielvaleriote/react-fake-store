## React Fake Store (Front-end)

With the data fetched from the **API**, I displayed fictional products as an E-commerce in a simple way, but with some features:

- **Responsiveness;**

- **Products sorting by price and rating;**

- **Rating shown with five stars system using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-star-ratings">react-star-ratings</a> module**;

- **Products filtering by name;**

- **Division by products categories;**

- **Single-Page Application with React-Router-DOM.**

  

## About the API

To fetch the data in this project, I used the <a href="https://fakestoreapi.com/">Fake Store API</a>, that returns an array of products containing: title, price, description, rating, id and image of the products.

## Yarn

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
